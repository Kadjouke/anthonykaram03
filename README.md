Hello my name is Anthony Karam. I am a sophomore undergraduate student studying Electrical Engineering at Houston Christian University (aka Houston Baptist University). 
My current plans for the future consist of getting a Masters in Computer Science.

I will be further updating my repository as I tackle on and complete new projects!
